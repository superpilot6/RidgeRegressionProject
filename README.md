# RidgeRegressionProject
This is a school project that compares the effectiveness of Ridge Regression versus other regression methods, such as ordinary least squares regression and principal components regression.
The goal of prediction in this context was to use a over 20 variables describing anonymized loans to train an algorithm to predict whether a loan not in the training subset will default or not.

The written report, the code, and the code output have been attached. Programming was done in R.
